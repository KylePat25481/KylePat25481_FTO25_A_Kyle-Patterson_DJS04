## 🎧 DSJ04 React Podcast App – Kyle Patterson

Welcome to my React Podcast App project!
This app lets users search, sort, filter, and paginate through a large list of podcasts in real time.
It’s built with React and showcases my ability to manage complex UI state while keeping everything smooth and responsive.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create an advanced podcast browsing experience that feels fast, intuitive, and organized.
Users can:

# 🔎 Search podcast titles dynamically as they type.

# ↕️ Sort shows by newest first or alphabetically (A–Z / Z–A).

# 🎯 Filter podcasts by genre using data from the data.js mapping file.

# 📄 Paginate results so the list remains readable and lightweight.

All of these features stay in sync so that changing one control (like a search or filter) won’t reset the others.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

React (Vite) – for a fast development experience.

Context API – to manage global state across search, filter, sort, and pagination.

JavaScript (ES6+) – modular, clean code with JSDoc comments.

CSS – responsive design and polished UI.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Live Search – Find podcasts instantly without needing the full title.
✅ Smart Sorting – Sort by newest updates or alphabetically (A–Z or Z–A).
✅ Genre Filtering – Narrow results to categories using the provided genre ID → title mapping.
✅ Pagination – Browse podcasts in manageable chunks without losing state.
✅ State Synchronization – Search, sort, filter, and pagination all work together seamlessly.
